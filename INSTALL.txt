To install django-mobileadmin, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``mobileadmin``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

Please see the `Usage` paragraph in doc/overview.txt for usage details. 

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a recent
Subversion checkout of Django. You can obtain Python from
http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
